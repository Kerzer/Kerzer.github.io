        <description>First step in your exploration of this data set should be to go and look at the map. This map shows Eviction count per council district. The following posts can be explored at will as they each tell a story based on what is seen. You will also be dicreted from the map tab to other stories, but you can come back here to see if you missed anything. If you want to see all the main content click here.</description>

        <description>This is the main section where you should do your exploration of how evictions happen in New York City. Before you move on spend a few minutes going through the options in the drop down menu to get a feel for what the map is showing you. When you are ready look below the map to find substories that relate to the most interesting viewings found in the map. Either view the map based on boroughs or with council districts which was the most common seperation of data found for New York City with regards to evictions.</description>

Welcome to the segment about general trends in the dataset. The main topic of this section will be to look at diference between the boroughs to find common denoimnotors across of all of New York City, but also see which boroughs deviate the most. If you have not seen the boroughs in the map go back and enable the right layout in the drop down menu.</description>

        <description>The main inspiration for this project came from the work concerning crime in San Francisco, which was done in relation to course 02806 about analysis and visualization of data. Based of the two initial projects done in the course one of the main features that stuck out was the use of geojson and plotly to add overlays to maps. These tools allowed us to make strong visualizations which allows the user to explore and understand the data at thier own pace.</description>
