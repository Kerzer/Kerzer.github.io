The main topic of this section will be to look at diference between the boroughs to find common denoimnotors across of all of New York City, but also see which boroughs deviate the most.

In this section the yearly trend found in the map is explained in greater detail.
Looking at the eviction count for the year 2020 it is alot lower than the previous years. The main reason for this is that evctions were stopped by the goverment because of Covid-19 which struck New York City early on in the pandemic.</description>
