        <description>This is the main section where you should do your exploration of how evictions happen in New York City. Before you move on spend a few minutes going through the options in the drop down menu to get a feel for what the map is showing you. When you are ready look below the map to find substories that relate to the most interesting viewings found in the map. Either view the map based on boroughs or with council districts which was the most common seperation of data found for New York City with regards to evictions.</description>
